# PHP Namespaces provide a way in which to group related classes, interfaces, functions and constants.
# Here is an example of namespace syntax in PHP:

/***
 * Actually there are 5 coding standards categories :
 * PSR-0 : Auto-loading Standard , which goal is to make the use of Namespaces easier, in order to convert a namespace into a file path.
 * PSR-1 : Basic Coding Standard , basically, standards :)
 * PSR-2 : Coding Style Guide, where to put braces, how to write a class, etc.
 * PSR-3 : Logger Interface , how to write a standard logger
 * PSR-4 : Improved Auto loading , to resolve more Namespaces into paths.
